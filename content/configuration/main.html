<p class="mt-3">There are two parts to configuring a device to run Kodi.</p>

<h4 class="mt-4">LibreELEC</h4>
<p class="mt-2">LibreELEC is a lightweight "Just enough OS" Linux distribution purpose-built for Kodi on current and popular media center hardware. LibreELEC is the operating system with Kodi already installed that is installed onto a computer. Before 2023 the computers used were Raspberry Pi 3 or 4 (single board computers). Since 2023 a full-blown mini desktop computer has been used.</p>

<p class="mt-2">Pictured is the <b>Beelink Mini S12 Pro</b> mini desktop computer. Each TV that plays media from the server has one of these "Kodi boxes" attached. The Kodi boxes read the content from the server.</p>


<h4 class="mt-4">Kodi</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Kodi is an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media player and entertainment hub that can be installed on Linux, OSX, Windows, iOS, tvOS and Android. It is designed around a "10-foot user interface" for use with televisions and remote controls. Kodi can play and view most videos, music, podcasts, games and other digital media files from local and network storage media and the internet.</p>
