<h1 class="display-4">LibreELEC</h1>
<p class="mt-3">It is easy to confuse LibreELEC with Kodi itself and several areas on this site will overlap. LibreELEC is the operating system - the software that starts when the computer is turned on. Kodi is the media application that is pre-installed on LibreELEC.</p>
<img src="/tech/kodi/content/configuration/LibreElec_About_(Amber).png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block" alt="LibreELEC About page on Kodi (using Amber skin)">

<h4 class="mt-4">Installation</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Installing LibreELEC is done by downloading the current version from the <a href="https://libreelec.tv/" target="blank">LibreELEC website</a> and writing the image to a high-quality thumbdrive. The easiest way to write the image is to use the <b>LibreELEC USB-SD Creator</b> from the LibreELEC downloads page. This tool will automatically download the selected version and write it to the thumbdrive you choose. Alternatively, you can download the image and write it to a USB drive manually in Linux.</p>

<p class="mt-2">After flashing the image the thumbdrive is plugged into the <b>Beelink Mini S12 Pro</b> mini desktop computer. The computer boots off the flash drive when powered-on and guides you through installation.</p>


<h4 class="mt-4">Configuration</h4>
<p class="mt-2">Getting LibreELEC installed and Kodi running takes answering just a few questions. During installation you'll be prompted to set a <b>Hostname</b>. The naming convention for computer host names used on my network are "XBMC" and a date code indicating the date of installation.</p>

<p class="mt-2">The following table lists the host names for the Kodi boxes installed.</p>
<div class="m-3 table-responsive">
  <table class="table">
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td class="nowrap">XBMC-2308</td>
      <td>Beelink mini computer in living room installed in August 2023.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nowrap">XBMC-2309</td>
      <td>Beelink mini computer in bedroom installed in September 2023.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class="nowrap">XBMC-2405</td>
      <td>Beelink mini computer in Charlotte installed in May 2024.</td>
    </tr>

  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

<p class="mt-2 note">Until a few years ago Kodi was called <b>XBMC</b> which stood for <i>XBox Media Center</i>. The named was changed a few years ago for copyright reasons.</p>
